//Java is Object Oriented
//organizes software design around data (objects) rather than functions and logic
//objects is a data field that has unique attributes and behavior
//OOP focuses on the objects that we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them
//OOP is best suited for large, complex programs

//Classes - data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes, and methods

//Objects - instances of a class created with specifically defined data
